The first thing we need to do is to import the required packages and modules. In this project, we import psutil, pynotifier packages to make use of their functions.

1 import psutil
2 from pynotifier import Notification

After the import section, we need to define our variables like :
battery = psutil.sensors_battery()
which creates an object for the battery

plugged = battery.power_plugged
It gives us information on whether the charger is plugged or not.

percent = battery.percent
It provides us the battery percentage of our system.

1 battery = psutil.sensors_battery()
2 plugged = battery.power_plugged
3 percent = battery.percent

In the next section, we start implementing the main part of our project.
In this section, we check whether the percent (Percentage level of our battery) is below the minimum rate which we fix and if our system is plugged in with a charger or not.

1 if percent <= 30 and plugged!=True:
2   Notification(
3       title="Battery Low",
4       description=str(percent) + "% Battery remain!!",
5       duration=5,  # Duration in seconds
6 
7   ).send()

If the above condition is satisfied, we will send a notification to the OS that our battery percentage is low. Otherwise, we donâ€™t do anything.
